# Seismic ColorMap

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gatechzhu/SeisCM.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gatechzhu/SeisCM)

## Introduction
As geophysicists can never agree on a standard colormap to plot seismic datasets that make every one happy, I try to make a package that include most common colormaps so that I can call them simply by import a package. 
This package is designed to be minimal initially and try to include as manny cm as possible. 
Open a pull request for any new colormap that you want me to include and I will put it in the package as soon as possible.
 
 Here is a list of available colormap now:
 - Blue-White-Red (when alpha is 0, it is the default seismic cm)
